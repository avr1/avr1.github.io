## Welcome to the Summer 2021 Program for Framingham Public School Robotics

This is the main landing page for our program. Basically, every resource I bring up, every slideshow I present, and any general information can be found here. If you ever feel the need to send me an email, you can also do so from here.

## Initial Plan

Since we have 40 hours of instruction, we have a lot of time to play with. 12-15 hours is already scheduled to build the basic [Clawbot](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/V5-Clawbot-BuildInstructions-0720.pdf), so this is a good place to start.

While building, it may make sense to demonstrate a classroom game that can use some of the existing VEX competition pieces, like [cones](https://static.rapidonline.com/catalogueimages/product/70/81/s70-8152p01wl.jpg)  and [mobile goals](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fN_RZTe6jyI/maxresdefault.jpg), that will allow for the students to plan strategy with the robot. This entire competition phase may take 5-10 hours.

After this, we can open up the course a bit more, depending on the students' level of experience and their interests. For example, if they are interested in programming, we can do a competition to automatically load up as many cones as they can, or program a robot to move somewhere else.

If they're interested in building, we can add a modification to the existing game, in order to ask them to expand their design. Say, for example, if the goal is placed a foot high in the air. This would require some design, but it is important to not make this too difficult.
