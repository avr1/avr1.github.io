title: About me

I'm a third year student at Northeastern Univeristy majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration.

I'm also involved with a few open-source projects, and I'm excited to learn more about scalability and cloud computing.

### My story

I was always interested in technology, so it was no suprise when I got my parents to get me a new iPod nano on my 5th birthday.
