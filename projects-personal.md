## Welcome to my personal projects page

Welcome to my personal projects gallery! Here, you can see some of the things I work on, whether they are for school, just for kicks, or to learn something new. Each one of these will be accompanied by a write-up about what I did, and will be added here. Enjoy!


- Here's an example of a project my team members and I made for school. It's a cool way to compress pictures to different resolutions while being able to remove only the boring pixels using a seam carving algorithm.
