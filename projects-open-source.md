## Welcome to my open source projects page

### I've done some work with the following projects:

#### [The Servo Project](https://servo.org/)

Servo is a browser engine built in the Rust Programming Language aiming for better parallelism, security, and modularity.

- Optimized the Servo Browser Engine's HTML parser to get an elementâ€™s target and noopener in accordance to the specification.        

- Updated a dependency to the latest crate of euclid in several different codebases, including lyon, surfman, surfman_api, servo, canvas, canvas_traits, and compositing.

- Added and updated unit tests to work with the CI build.

- Updated relavant crates to support the latest version of macOS.

#### [lxc](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/)

LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features that lets Linux users easily create and manage system or application containers.

- Updated documentation to reflect the incompatibility of LXC with pure unfiltered systems like cfgroupsv2

#### [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- Updated documentation to remove a broken link to an analytics page.
- Part of the Storage Special Interest Group.
